# Lab React developer evaluation

## Briefing 
We want to build small photo stream prototype in React.
It needs to load photos from a rest endpoint and display them in a feed.
            
Since we do not have a backend (yet) we will use fake data from <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos?_start=0&_end=10">JsonPlaceholder</a>

 - Each photo should display with its title overlayed
 - Each photo should have a (fake) "like" button
 - Initially the app should only load 3 photos
 - Users should be able to load more photos
 - Feel free to add your own requirements

We would prefer that you create a pull(merge) request to the this repo so we can easily evaluate your work.

            
Good luck!
